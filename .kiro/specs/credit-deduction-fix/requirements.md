# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses an issue where user credits are being deducted upon page reload. Currently, when a user refreshes the page during certain operations, the system incorrectly deducts credits from their account multiple times for the same action. This creates a poor user experience and can lead to financial losses for users. The goal is to implement a solution that prevents duplicate credit deductions during page reloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my credits to be deducted only once when I make a purchase or order a service, so that I don't lose credits when I reload the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an order THEN the system SHALL deduct credits only once
2. WHEN a user reloads the page during or after an order creation THEN the system SHALL NOT deduct additional credits
3. WHEN a transaction is in progress and the page is reloaded THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent duplicate transactions
4. WHEN a user attempts to create the same order multiple times THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate orders and credit deductions
5. WHEN a credit deduction operation fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL ensure credits are not lost

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement idempotent credit transactions, so that the same operation is not executed multiple times regardless of how many times it is requested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a credit transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate a unique transaction identifier
2. WHEN a transaction with the same identifier is attempted again THEN the system SHALL recognize and prevent the duplicate transaction
3. WHEN a transaction is in progress THEN the system SHALL lock the transaction until it completes or fails
4. WHEN a transaction fails THEN the system SHALL properly roll back any partial changes
5. WHEN a transaction is completed THEN the system SHALL record the transaction details for audit purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear feedback about my credit transactions, so that I understand when credits are deducted and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a credit transaction is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
2. WHEN a credit transaction fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with a clear explanation
3. WHEN a duplicate transaction is prevented THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the operation was already processed
4. WHEN a user's credits are insufficient THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating insufficient funds
5. WHEN a user views their transaction history THEN the system SHALL show accurate records of all credit transactions
